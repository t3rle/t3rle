## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob, and Iâ€™m a software engineering student passionate about exploring ideas and turning them into something useful.  
I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and constantly learning along the way.  

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll often find me climbing or experimenting with photography ^^
